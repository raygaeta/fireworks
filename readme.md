# Interactive Fireworks Animation ðŸŽ†

#### This project demonstrates how to create an interactive fireworks display using WebGL and Three.js. The fireworks are triggered by user clicks, producing dynamic particle animations with realistic effects. This lesson is perfect for developers looking to add visually stunning and interactive visuals to their applications.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

### ðŸŽ‡ Dynamic Fireworks Effects
#### Particles burst outward rapidly, scale up, fall slowly, scale down, and twinkle as they disappear, mimicking the natural motion of fireworks.

### âœ¨ User Interaction
#### Fireworks are triggered by mouse clicks, allowing users to create custom displays anywhere on the screen.

### ðŸ’» GPU-Driven Performance
#### Leverages shaders for particle animation, ensuring smooth performance and seamless rendering.

### ðŸŽ¨ Customizable Parameters
#### Easily tweak properties such as explosion size, particle colors, and animation speed to create unique fireworks displays tailored to your needs.
